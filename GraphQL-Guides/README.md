# Vega GraphQL Guides

These guides will guide you through the process of interacting with the Vega Derivatives trading platform using GraphQL.

## React GraphQL Libraries

To interact with the Vega GraphQL server we will use [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).

You can enable near real-time updates using [Subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/).
