# Vega GraphQL Guides

These guides take you through the process of interacting with the [Vega Protocol](https://vega.xyz/) decentralized derivatives trading platform using GraphQL.

The guides feature a collection of walk-through and feature showcase applications using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

[Step-by-step documentation](https://github.com/ben-razor/vega-guide/tree/main/GraphQL-Guides/docs) is provided to take you though the applications from simple market data exploration to Vega Protocol mastery using GraphQL.

## React GraphQL Libraries

To interact with the Vega GraphQL server we will use [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).

Using GraphQL with Vega allows near real-time updates using [Subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/).

## Inspiration

We use the [Svelte Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) and [Svelete Examples](https://svelte.dev/examples#hello-world) as inspiration for simple hands-on getting-started documentation.
