## Initialization

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Apollo GraphQL Client

GraphQL queries are made using the [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/).

The [Apollo Query Guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/) was followed to create the query code.

## Inspiration

We use the [Svelte Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) and [Svelete Examples](https://svelte.dev/examples#hello-world) as inspiration for simple hands-on getting-started documentation.
