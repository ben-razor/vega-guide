# Vega Step by Step using GraphQL

{{< columns >}}
## Vega Protocol

[Vega Protocol](https://vega.xyz/) is a decentralized derivatives trading platform.

To learn how to create a wallet and use the online [Console](https://console.fairground.wtf/) and APIs, view the [Vega Documentation](https://docs.fairground.vega.xyz/).

Vega provides APIs to interact with the platform using REST, gRPC and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

## GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a concise language for making queries that offers fine-grained control over the returned results.

You use the flexible [Vega GraphQL playground](https://lb.testnet.vega.xyz/playground) to explore the API and execute queries against the Vega Protocol API.
