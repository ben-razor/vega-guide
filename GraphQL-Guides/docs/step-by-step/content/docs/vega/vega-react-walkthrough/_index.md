# Vega GraphQL Walkthrough

## Introduction 

This guide will introduce you to interacting with the Vega Protocol using GraphQL.

To help you get familar with the GraphQL API, we provide an online [Walkthrough Application](https://vega-walkthrough.web.app/) to exectute queries and updates.

Along the way you will learn how to:

- View markets, orders, trades and accounts
- Subscribe to live market updates
- Place orders and manage your account
- Interact with the Vega Ecosystem through Governance Proposals


This guide is for those looking for a starting point to build ReactJS applications that use the Vega GraphQL API.

The source for the application can be found at [vega-walkthrough](https://github.com/ben-razor/vega-guide/tree/main/GraphQL-Guides/apps/vega-walkthrough).

If you are looking for a guide on how to create a React application that interacts with the Vega GraphQL API, take a look at the [Vega GraphQL React Starter]({{< relref "/docs/vega/vega-react.md" >}}) tutorial.
