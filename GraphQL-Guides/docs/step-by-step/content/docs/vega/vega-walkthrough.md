# Vega GraphQL Walkthrough

## Introduction 

To help you get familar with the Vega Protocol GraphQL API, we provide an online [Walkthrough Application](https://vega-walkthrough.web.app/) to exectute queries and updates.

Along the way you will learn how to:

- View markets, orders, trades and accounts
- Subscribe to live market updates
- Place orders and manage your account
- Interact with the Vega Ecosystem through Governance Proposals

The source for the application can be found at [vega-walkthrough](https://github.com/ben-razor/vega-guide/tree/main/GraphQL-Guides/apps/vega-walkthrough).

If you are looking for a guide on how to create a **ReactJS** application that interacts with the Vega GraphQL API, take a look at the [Vega GraphQL React Starter]({{< relref "/docs/vega/vega-react.md" >}}) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

#### Vega

Before using this guide check out the [Vega Documentation](https://docs.fairground.vega.xyz/).

You can try out Vega using on the web using the [Testnet Fairground Console](https://console.fairground.wtf/).

#### GraphQL Playground

Open the [Vega GraphQL playground](https://lb.testnet.vega.xyz/playground). You can use it alongside the walkthrough to explore the full Vega GraphQL API.
