# Vega Guide

This repositiory explores [Vega Protocol](https://vega.xyz/) as part of the Gitcoin GR11 Hackathon.

Vega Protocol is a decentralized platform for trading derivatives.

Vega runs on it's own blockchain. Assets will be bridged from other networks for trading.

## Vega Fairground

At the time of the hackathon, the network is running on testnet and there is a [web based playground app](https://fairground.wtf/).

## Vega GraphQL

A handy tool for exploring the GraphQL API is the [Vega GraphQL Playground](https://lb.testnet.vega.xyz/playground)

## GR11 Hackathon

The GraphQL guides are created for the [GraphQL Reference Applications](https://gitcoin.co/issue/vegaprotocol/bounties/11/100026491) bounties of the [GR11 Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr11/)
