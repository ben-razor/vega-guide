# Vega Guide

This repositiory explores [Vega Protocol](https://vega.xyz/) as part of the Gitcoin GR11 Hackathon.

Vega Protocol is a decentralized platform for trading derivatives.

Vega runs on it's own blockchain. Assets will be bridged from other networks for trading.

## Vega Fairground

At the time of the hackathon, the network is running on testnet and there is a [web based playground app](https://fairground.wtf/).

## Vega GraphQL

A handy tool for exploring the GraphQL API is the [Vega GraphQL Playground](https://lb.testnet.vega.xyz/playground)
